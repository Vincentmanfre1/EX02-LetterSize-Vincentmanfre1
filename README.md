## Exercise: LetterSize (25 Points)

The project name of this exercise is **LetterSize**.

The purpose of this assignment is for you to write more of your own comments, use fundamental data types, and to use constants in your program.

### Problem Description

The purpose of this assignment is to practice what we learned about constants, variables and formatted output. 

Write a program that displays the dimensions of a letter-size (8.5 Ã— 11 inches) sheet of paper in millimeters. Be sure to print it out so that there are two numbers after the decimal point for the conversions. There are 25.4 millimeters per inch. Use constants and comments in your program. 

_Hint_: When using `System.out.printf` the format specifier for two digits is listed on page 40 in [Think Java](http://greenteapress.com/thinkjava6/thinkjava.pdf) . 

### Getting Started

The first thing you will need to do is accept the invitation to this assignment
from GitHub Classroom. You can click [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/UO9xHmbD) to accept the invitation, and then
follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/vc-csv40-spring2019/Course-Information/wiki)
to get started. 

Be sure that you accept the invitation first and use the URL from
the your new project when you clone it in Intellij.

Like our last exercise, we are going to start by creating a Java class. The file for this project is called **LetterSize.java**. Right click on `src` select `New -> Java Class` to create a class called **edu.vcccd.vc.csv40.LetterSize**.

That lass action will create a file named **LetterSize.java**. This file is where your source code will go. Replace the code in that file with the code in the grey box below:

```java
/**
 * CS V40 Beginning Java
 * Assignment: LetterSize
 * 
 * Statement of code ownership: I hereby state that I have written all of this
 * code and I have not copied this code from any other person or source.
 * 
 * @author [CHANGE THIS TO YOUR INFORMATION]
 */
package edu.vcccd.vc.csv40;

/**
 * This class tests the LetterSize object.
 *
 */
public class LetterSize {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Put your code for this project here.
    }
}
```

Now go through **LetterSize.java** and change the [CHANGE THIS TO YOUR INFORMATION] text to your name and email address.

Next, write your code that prints a string to the console with the computed letter size in `public static void main` between the curly braces. The output
should first output the width in millimeters, and then the height in millimeters. The output should look something like:

```bash
000.00 mm X 000.00 mm
```

The zeroes should be replaced with the actual 8.5" X 11" converted to millimeters. This conversion should occur in your code.

Once you've written your code run the code by LetterSize in the target drop-down box and the pressing the play button. Examine the output. Does it do what you want? If not, how can you modify the code to do what you want?

Next, make sure it also passes the Unit tests. To run the Unit tests select the LetterSizeTest target and press the play button. 


### How to turn in this exercise

The first step of turning in your code is to commit and push your code to GitHub. Once you've completed this step your code will be on GitHub in your repository. This will allow you to use all your projects later as a portfolio.

To start the process right-click the project name and select **Git -> Commit Directory...**. Be sure to enter a commit message in the "Commit Message" box and then press the **Commit** button. 

Next, push the code to GitHub. Again, right-click the project name and select **Git -> Repository -> Push**. Then press the **Push** button and that's it. The result of your build and tests will be sent to the [#build](https://vc-csv40-spring2019.slack.com/messages/CFK9MU6GK) channel on slack.
